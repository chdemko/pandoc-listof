# pandoc-listof

*pandoc-listof* is a [pandoc] filter for listof all kinds of things.

Each paragraph containing only a string `{`*name*`}` will be replaced by a list of link pointing to all `span` whose `id`
is *name*`:`*identifier*.

Demonstration: Using [pandoc-listof-sample.md] as input gives output files in [pdf], [tex], [html], [epub], [md] and
other formats.
